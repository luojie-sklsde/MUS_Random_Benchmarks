# MUS\_Random\_Benchmarks
Randomly generated benchmarks for MUSes enumeration.

## Format of filenames
All filenames are in the format of **{label}\_marco\_input\_{lnum}\_{cnum}**. And all files are in the standard DIMACS CNF format.

- The **label** is a random string.
- The **lnum** is the number of different literals of this instance.
- The **cnum** is the number of clauses of this instance.
